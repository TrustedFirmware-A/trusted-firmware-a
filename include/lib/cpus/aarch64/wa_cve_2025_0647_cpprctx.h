/*
 * API to perform CPP RCTX instruction functionality in EL3
 *
 * Rather than trapping EL3 to EL3 if CPP RCTX is needed, it is simpler to just
 * have an API that performs the workaround steps. TF-A does not support nested
 * exceptions outside of specific circumstances, and enabling that generically
 * is not trivial, so this is a simpler and faster solution.
 *
 * The workaround is not reliant on the config register passed to the CPP RCTX
 * instruction, but the argument is included for compatibility in systems that
 * might have some cores that need the workaround and some that do not. If the
 * workaround is not needed, the argument will be used in a normal CPP RCTX call
 * rather than the workaround procedure.

 * System register definitions used in this workaround

 * all CPUs affected by this issue share these definitions, but if future CPUs
 * have different register mappings this will need to be updated to pull from
